# Aquarium Stock Helper


## Summary
My final project for the Building AI online course. The program calculates the amount of specific fish you could keep in an aquarium of your preferred size. It's based on a more in-depth version of the '1 centimeter of fish length per liter' rule that takes into account the actual size of the fish, not just its length. The program also considers the level of depth the species typically spends most of its time at: the top, middle or bottom.

## Background
Those new to the aquarium-keeping world, that is to say, people who've never kept fish in a fish tank before, often find the amount of contradictory information online confusing. "How many fish can I fit in a fish tank of x size" is one of the most common issues you'll see on online forums related to the subject. I'm still relatively new to the whole business myself and have gone through the painstaking loop of confusion multiple times already, so I figured that a calculator like this might come in handy for others like me. 

## How is it used?
You merely insert the measurements of your fish tank and information on the fish species you are interested in - the length and level that the fish typically swims at - and the program calculates the maximum amount of fish you'd be able to keep in your tank. I'll hopefully one day be able to integrate a small databank of the most common species of aquarium fish so that you won't have to search up this information yourself. 

When you add information on multiple species of fish, there will be a kind of slider that allows you to change the distribution of fish - for example, if you have a species that's 5 cm in length and another that's 10 cm, you can either have way more of the 5 cm ones and just one or two of the 10 cm ones, or you can get as many 10 cm long fish as possible and only the minimum amount of the 5 cm fish - or anything in between, obviously. 

I'd also like to integrate something like a warning that pops up if the maximum amount of the species of fish you can fit in your tank is less than the minimum amount of fish required for keeping. With some species of tetras, for example, it's recommended to keep them in schools of an absolute minimum of 10 fish, with the recommended amount being between 20-30 or even more. If you can only fit 7 tetras in your fish tank, they'll likely become very unhappy and stressed.

## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |
## Challenges
What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?
## What next?
How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
